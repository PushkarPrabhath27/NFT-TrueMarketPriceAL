# Real-Time Update System Implementation Prompt

## Overview

You are tasked with building a Real-Time Update Engine that keeps trust scores, price predictions, and risk assessments continuously updated based on new information. This system will process events from multiple sources, trigger appropriate updates, and notify users of significant changes.

## Core Functionalities to Implement

### 1. Event Source Integration

**Objective**: Create a comprehensive system that captures relevant events from multiple sources in real-time.

**Implementation Requirements**:

1. **Blockchain Event Monitoring**:
   - Implement listeners for the following blockchain events:
     - NFT transfers (ownership changes)
     - Sale completions across major marketplaces
     - New NFT minting events
     - Collection contract updates
     - Creator activity events (new NFTs, collection creation)
   - Design a resilient connection system with:
     - Automatic reconnection on failure
     - Multiple node providers for redundancy
     - Block confirmation requirements for finality
     - Reorg handling for chain reorganizations
     - Historical event backfilling capabilities

2. **Fraud Detection System Integration**:
   - Create webhook receivers for the following update types:
     - New image analysis results
     - Updated similarity scores
     - Wash trading detection alerts
     - Metadata validation changes
   - Implement processing queues with:
     - Priority assignment based on update significance
     - Duplicate detection and handling
     - Error handling with appropriate retry logic
     - Result verification and validation
     - Processing confirmation callbacks

3. **Social Media Monitoring Integration**:
   - Design connectors for social data updates:
     - Mention frequency changes
     - Sentiment shifts in discussions
     - Follower count and engagement metrics
     - Creator announcement monitoring
     - Community growth or decline indicators
   - Create data normalization pipeline with:
     - Source-specific data transformation
     - Signal extraction from noise
     - Significance thresholding
     - Temporal pattern detection
     - Artificial engagement filtering

4. **Market Condition Monitoring**:
   - Implement detectors for market changes:
     - Floor price movements in collections
     - Volume anomalies (spikes or drops)
     - Market-wide trend shifts
     - Similar NFT sales
     - Creator portfolio performance changes
   - Create significance evaluation with:
     - Percentage change thresholds
     - Statistical outlier detection
     - Trend break identification
     - Comparative analysis
