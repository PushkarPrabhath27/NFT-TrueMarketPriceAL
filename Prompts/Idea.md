# Trust Score Engine & Price Prediction

## Your Role and Objectives

You're responsible for developing the core intelligence of our platform: the Trust Score Engine and Price Prediction systems. These components will analyze data from other modules to generate actionable intelligence about NFT trustworthiness and fair market value, helping users make informed decisions.

## Core Functionalities to Implement

### 1. Dynamic Trust Score Calculation
- Develop a comprehensive scoring algorithm that considers:
  - Results from fraud detection systems (image analysis, wash trading)
  - Creator reputation and history
  - Collection performance and legitimacy
  - Marketplace verification status
  - Transaction history patterns
  - Social media validation
- Implement a weighted scoring system with configurable parameters
- Create separate but related scores for:
  - NFT Trust Score (0-100%)
  - Creator Reputation Score (0-100%)
  - Collection Trust Score (0-100%)
- Design a system for score updates based on new information
- Implement confidence intervals for all trust scores

### 2. Trust Factor Analysis
- Develop granular trust factors that contribute to the overall score:
  - Originality Factor (based on image analysis)
  - Transaction Legitimacy Factor (based on wallet analysis)
  - Creator History Factor (based on past NFTs and activities)
  - Metadata Consistency Factor (based on property validation)
  - Social Validation Factor (based on community engagement)
  - Marketplace Trust Factor (based on platform reputation)
- Create detailed explanations for each factor's contribution
- Implement visual representation of factor weights and impacts
- Design interfaces for factor customization by users

### 3. Price Intelligence Engine
- Build machine learning models for price prediction:
  - Regression models for baseline pricing
  - Time series analysis (ARIMA, LSTM) for trend prediction
  - Comparable sales analysis for similar NFTs
  - Rarity-based valuation models
- Implement the following price intelligence features:
  - Current Fair Value Estimation
  - Price Trend Prediction (7/30/90 day forecasts)
  - Undervalued/Overvalued Indicators
  - Price Volatility Metrics
  - Confidence Intervals for All Predictions
- Create visualization tools for price history and predictions
- Design alerting systems for significant price movements

### 4. Multi-Factor Risk Assessment
- Develop a comprehensive risk evaluation system that considers:
  - Trust score components
  - Price volatility and stability
  - Market liquidity for similar NFTs
  - Creator abandonment risk
  - Collection sustainability metrics
  - Market timing factors
- Create a Risk Profile with multiple dimensions
- Implement personalized risk thresholds based on user preferences
- Design visualizations to communicate complex risk factors

### 5. Real-Time Update Engine
- Build systems to update scores and predictions based on:
  - New transactions
  - Social media activity changes
  - Creator behavior updates
  - Market condition shifts
  - New fraud detection findings
- Implement event-driven architecture for immediate updates
- Create notification systems for significant changes
- Design caching mechanisms for performance optimization

### 6. Trust & Price API
- Develop an internal API with endpoints for:
  - `/scores/nft/{token_id}` - Get complete trust scores for an NFT
  - `/scores/creator/{address}` - Get creator reputation details
  - `/scores/collection/{collection_id}` - Get collection trust metrics
  - `/price/prediction/{token_id}` - Get price intelligence data
  - `/risk/profile/{token_id}` - Get comprehensive risk assessment
- Implement filtering and customization options
- Create detailed response formats with explanations
- Design caching and performance optimization

## Technical Requirements

### Programming Languages & Libraries
- Python 3.9+ for algorithm development
- Libraries to consider:
  - `scikit-learn` for ML models
  - `tensorflow` or `pytorch` for deep learning price models
  - `statsmodels` for statistical analysis
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `FastAPI` for API development
  - `celery` for background processing

### Infrastructure
- Time-series database for price history (InfluxDB or TimescaleDB)
- Redis for caching and real-time updates
- PostgreSQL for relational data storage
- Queue system for processing updates (RabbitMQ or Redis)

### Architecture Considerations
- Design for high throughput and low latency
- Implement event-sourcing for tracking score changes
- Create modular systems for easy algorithm updates
- Design for explainability in all decisions

## Integration Points

### Input Integrations
- Connect to Blockchain Data Extraction for:
  - NFT metadata and properties
  - Transaction histories and wallet data
  - Creator and collection information
- Integrate with AI-Powered Fraud Detection for:
  - Image analysis results
  - Wash trading detection findings
  - Metadata validation outcomes
  - Creator verification assessments
- Implement social media analysis connectors (optional phase)

### Output Integrations
- Provide trust scores and price predictions to Dashboard & UI
- Create detailed data exports for reporting
- Generate alerts for significant trust or price changes
- Supply explanation data for user education
