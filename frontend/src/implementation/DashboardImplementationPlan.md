### Component-Based Architecture
- Organize components into logical categories:
  - Layout components (Header, Sidebar, Footer)
  - Dashboard components (Cards, Panels, Tabs)
  - Visualization components (Charts, Graphs, Indicators)
  - Interactive components (Filters, Controls, Forms)
  - Educational components (Tooltips, Guides, Tutorials)
- Implement component composition for maximum reusability
- Create a component library with storybook documentation

### Accessibility Compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Ensure proper color contrast ratios throughout the application
- Implement keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Add ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility
- Create focus management for modal dialogs and complex widgets
