# Hathor Network Nano Contracts Integration

## Overview

This module integrates Hathor Network's nano contracts architecture with the NFT TrustScore platform. Unlike traditional smart contracts where each contract has its own source code and state, Hathor's nano contracts reference shared blueprints while maintaining their own state.

## Key Components

### Hathor Connection Provider

- **HathorProvider**: Implements blockchain connection interfaces for Hathor Network
- **NanoContractClient**: Specialized client for interacting with nano contracts

### Blueprint Registry

- **BlueprintRegistry**: Tracks and indexes available blueprints (both built-in and on-chain)
- **BlueprintAnalyzer**: Analyzes blueprint code for security and trust implications

### Nano Contract Data Extraction

- **ContractExtractor**: Extracts nano contract data including state and transaction history
- **BlueprintResolver**: Resolves blueprint references to their source implementations
- **StateAnalyzer**: Analyzes contract state for trust score calculations

### Trust Score Adaptation

- **HathorTrustFactor**: Specialized trust factor for Hathor nano contracts
- **BlueprintTrustMetrics**: Evaluates blueprint quality and security properties
- **ContractStateValidator**: Validates contract state against expected patterns

## Integration with Trust Score Engine

The Hathor integration extends the existing trust score system with new factors specific to nano contracts:

1. **Blueprint Quality Factor**: Evaluates the quality and security of the blueprint a contract references
2. **Contract State Integrity**: Analyzes the contract's state for consistency and expected patterns
3. **Multi-Token Balance Analysis**: Examines the contract's token holdings for suspicious patterns
4. **Transaction Pattern Analysis**: Specialized analysis for Hathor's unique transaction model

## Implementation Roadmap

- [x] Documentation and architecture design
- [ ] Hathor Network connection provider
- [ ] Blueprint registry and analyzer
- [ ] Nano contract data extraction pipeline
- [ ] Trust score factor implementation
- [ ] Integration with main trust score engine
- [ ] Testing and validation

## Usage

```typescript
// Example usage (to be implemented)
import { HathorProvider } from '../blockchain/hathor/connection/HathorProvider';
import { NanoContractExtractor } from '../blockchain/hathor/extraction/NanoContractExtractor';

// Initialize Hathor provider
const hathorProvider = new HathorProvider({
  network: 'mainnet',
  apiUrl: 'https://node1.hathor.network/v1a/'
});

// Extract nano contract data
const contractExtractor = new NanoContractExtractor(hathorProvider);
const contractData = await contractExtractor.extractContractData(contractId);

// Use in trust score calculation
const trustScoreEngine = new TrustScoreEngine();
const trustScore = await trustScoreEngine.calculateNFTTrustScore(nftId, {
  ...inputData,
  hathorContractData: contractData
});
```
