# NFT Trust Score Engine

## Overview

The Trust Score Engine is a comprehensive system for calculating trust scores for NFTs, creators, and collections. It analyzes multiple data points across various dimensions to provide users with reliable trust assessments, helping them make informed decisions about potential purchases and investments.

## Key Components

### Core Engine

- **TrustScoreEngine**: The main orchestrator that calculates trust scores across multiple dimensions.

### Trust Factors

The engine evaluates the following trust factors, each contributing a weighted percentage to the overall score:

1. **Originality Factor (20%)**: Evaluates NFT uniqueness based on image similarity detection.
2. **Transaction Legitimacy Factor (20%)**: Analyzes transaction patterns to detect wash trading and price manipulation.
3. **Creator Reputation Factor (15%)**: Assesses creator's historical NFT quality and project delivery.
4. **Collection Performance Factor (15%)**: Analyzes floor price stability, trading volume, and holder distribution.
5. **Metadata Consistency Factor (10%)**: Validates properties format, external references, and collection consistency.
6. **Marketplace Verification Factor (10%)**: Incorporates verification status across platforms.
7. **Social Validation Factor (10%)**: Analyzes mention frequency, sentiment, and engagement metrics.

### Supporting Systems

- **ScoreAggregator**: Combines individual factor scores into comprehensive trust scores.
- **HistoricalTracker**: Maintains historical trust score data for trend analysis.
- **TrustFactorAnalyzer**: Provides detailed analysis of trust factors with rich explanations.
- **RiskAssessmentEngine**: Evaluates risk across multiple dimensions based on trust factors.
- **TrustScoreUpdateManager**: Processes events and triggers trust score updates.

## Usage

### Calculating a Trust Score

```typescript
import { TrustScoreEngine, TrustScoreTypes } from '../trust_score';

// Initialize the engine
const trustScoreEngine = new TrustScoreEngine();

// Prepare input data
const nftData: TrustScoreTypes.NFTInputData = {
  tokenId: '123456',
  contractAddress: '0x1234567890abcdef',
  creatorAddress: '0xabcdef1234567890',
  ownerAddress: '0x0987654321fedcba',
  creationTimestamp: '2023-01-15T12:00:00Z',
  transactionHistory: [...],
  metadata: {...},
  imageSimilarityResults: [...],
  socialSignals: [...],
  marketplaceVerifications: [...],
  creatorHistory: {...},
  collectionData: {...}
};

// Calculate trust score
const trustScore = await trustScoreEngine.calculateNFTTrustScore(nftData.tokenId, nftData);

// Get detailed analysis
const analysis = trustScoreEngine.analyzeTrustFactors(nftData.tokenId, trustScore);

// Get risk assessment
const riskProfile = trustScoreEngine.assessRisk(nftData.tokenId, trustScore);
```

### Handling Update Events

```typescript
// Process an event that might affect trust scores
trustScoreEngine.handleUpdateEvent({
  eventType: 'sale',
  timestamp: '2023-02-01T15:30:00Z',
  entityId: '123456',
  entityType: 'nft',
  data: {
    fromAddress: '0x1111111111111111',
    toAddress: '0x2222222222222222',
    value: '1500000000000000000' // 1.5 ETH in wei
  }
});
```

## Data Requirements

The Trust Score Engine requires comprehensive data for accurate scoring. The more complete the data, the higher the confidence in the calculated scores. Key data points include:

- Blockchain transaction history
- NFT metadata and image analysis results
- Creator history and verification status
- Collection performance metrics
- Marketplace verification status
- Social validation signals

## Confidence Metrics

All trust scores include confidence metrics (0-1) that indicate the reliability of the score based on data completeness and quality. Scores with low confidence should be interpreted with caution.

## Extending the Engine

The Trust Score Engine is designed to be extensible. New factor calculators can be implemented by extending the `FactorCalculator` interface.

```typescript
import { FactorCalculator, TrustScoreTypes } from '../trust_score';

export class CustomFactor implements FactorCalculator {
  public readonly weight: number;
  
  constructor(weight: number = 0.10) {
    this.weight = weight;
  }
  
  public async calculate(inputData: TrustScoreTypes.NFTInputData): Promise<TrustScoreTypes.FactorScore> {
    // Custom implementation
  }
  
  // Implement other required methods
}
```

## Integration Points

The Trust Score Engine integrates with other systems through:

1. **Blockchain Data Extraction**: Consumes transaction history and metadata
2. **Fraud Detection System**: Incorporates image analysis and pattern detection results
3. **User Interface**: Provides scores and analysis for display
4. **API Layer**: Exposes trust scores and risk assessments via endpoints
