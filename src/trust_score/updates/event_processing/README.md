# Event Processing and Routing System

## Overview

The Event Processing and Routing system is a core component of the NFT TrustScore's Real-Time Update Engine. It efficiently processes incoming events from various sources, determines their impact, and routes them to appropriate update handlers. This system ensures that trust scores, price predictions, and risk assessments are continuously updated based on new information in a timely and efficient manner.

## Architecture

The system is composed of five main components that work together to provide a comprehensive event processing pipeline:

1. **Event Classifier**: Categorizes events and maps their entity associations
2. **Event Prioritizer**: Assigns priorities to events based on their importance
3. **Processing Queue Manager**: Manages distributed queues for reliable event processing
4. **Event Router**: Determines how events should be processed
5. **Event Dispatcher**: Routes events to appropriate handlers using different dispatch mechanisms

These components are integrated through the `EventProcessingSystem` class, which provides a unified interface for the entire system.

## Components

### Event Classifier

The Event Classifier categorizes events based on their type, maps their entity associations, and assesses their impact for prioritization. It provides:

- Event type categorization (transfer, sale, metadata update, etc.)
- Entity association mapping (NFT, collection, creator)
- Impact assessment for prioritization
- Urgency determination based on event type
- Dependency identification for processing order

### Event Prioritizer

The Event Prioritizer assigns priorities to events based on their type, source, and content to ensure the most important updates are processed first. It implements:

- Multi-factor priority scoring
- Dynamic queue management
- Priority boosting for critical events
- Starvation prevention for low-priority events
- Adaptive prioritization based on system load

### Processing Queue Manager

The Processing Queue Manager handles distributed queues for reliable and efficient event processing. It provides:

- Distributed queue implementation
- Topic-based routing for specialized processors
- Dead-letter handling for failed processing
- Retry policies with exponential backoff
- Queue monitoring and alerting

It also implements queue optimization techniques:

- Batching for similar events
- Deduplication for redundant events
- Conflation for rapidly changing entities
- Partitioning for parallel processing
- Backpressure handling for traffic spikes

### Event Router

The Event Router determines how events should be processed based on their type, content, and system configuration. It implements:

- Rule-based routing to appropriate handlers
- Update threshold configuration
- Notification threshold configuration
- Smart routing based on event content
- Cooldown periods for different entity types

### Event Dispatcher

The Event Dispatcher routes events to appropriate handlers and manages different dispatch mechanisms. It provides:

- Rule-based routing to appropriate handlers
- Dynamic handler discovery and registration
- Load-balanced distribution across handler instances
- Affinity routing for related events
- Fallback routing for handler failures

It also implements various dispatch mechanisms:

- Synchronous processing for critical updates
- Asynchronous processing for background updates
- Scheduled processing for batched operations
- Triggered processing for dependent events
- Conditional processing based on system state

## Usage

The Event Processing System can be used through the `EventProcessingSystem` class, which integrates all components and provides a unified interface:

```typescript
// Initialize the event processing system
const eventProcessingSystem = new EventProcessingSystem({
  classifierConfig: { /* ... */ },
  prioritizerConfig: { /* ... */ },
  queueManagerConfig: { /* ... */ },
  routerConfig: { /* ... */ },
  dispatcherConfig: { /* ... */ }
});

// Register event handlers
eventProcessingSystem.registerHandler(
  'handler-name',
  ['event_type_1', 'event_type_2'],
  ['entity_type_1', 'entity_type_2'],
  async (event) => {
    // Process event
  },
  { priority: 8, requiresSync: true }
);

// Process an event
await eventProcessingSystem.processEvent({
  id: 'event-123',
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  eventType: 'nft_sale',
  entityType: 'nft',
  entityId: 'nft-456',
  source: 'blockchain',
  data: { /* ... */ }
});
```

See the `EventProcessingExample.ts` file for a complete example of how to use the system.

## Integration

The Event Processing System integrates with the Real-Time Update Engine through the following components:

- **Event Sources**: Blockchain, Fraud Detection, Social Media, Market Condition
- **Update Consumers**: Trust Score Calculation Engine, Price Prediction Engine, Risk Assessment System
- **Notification System**: Notification Generator for user alerts

## Performance Considerations

The system is designed for high performance and scalability:

- Efficient event classification and prioritization
- Optimized queue management with batching and deduplication
- Load-balanced dispatch to handlers
- Configurable concurrency limits for synchronous and asynchronous operations
- Monitoring and alerting for queue depths and processing times

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- Retry policies with exponential backoff
- Dead-letter queues for failed events
- Error event emission for monitoring
- Fallback handlers for unknown event types
- Graceful degradation under high load

## Monitoring

The system emits events for monitoring:

- Event enqueued/processed/failed
- Batch processing start/complete/failure
- Handler registration/unregistration
- Dispatch success/failure
- Queue statistics

These events can be used to build dashboards and alerts for system monitoring.
