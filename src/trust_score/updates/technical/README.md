# NFT TrustScore Real-Time Update System - Technical Architecture

This document outlines the technical architecture for the NFT TrustScore real-time update system, focusing on the implementation of the core technical considerations and integration points.

## System Overview

The real-time update system is designed to efficiently process events from various sources, determine their impact on NFT trust scores, and selectively update affected components while generating appropriate notifications for users. The system is built with scalability, reliability, and performance in mind.

## Technical Architecture Components

### 1. Event Sourcing and Processing

#### Technology Selection

- **Event Streaming Platform**: Apache Kafka
  - Provides high-throughput, low-latency event processing
  - Supports topic-based message routing
  - Offers strong durability and partition tolerance
  - Enables event replay capabilities

- **Event Schema Management**: Apache Avro with Schema Registry
  - Ensures backward/forward compatibility
  - Provides efficient serialization/deserialization
  - Supports schema evolution with versioning

#### Implementation Strategy

- **Idempotent Processing**:
  - Event deduplication using unique event IDs
  - Exactly-once semantics through consumer offset management
  - Transactional updates to prevent partial processing

- **Event Persistence**:
  - Long-term storage in event log (Kafka retention policies)
  - Compacted topics for latest-state access
  - Event archiving for historical analysis

- **Event Transformation Pipeline**:
  - Raw event ingestion layer
  - Enrichment processors adding context
  - Normalization to standardized internal format
  - Domain-specific transformation for downstream consumers

### 2. Distributed Systems Design

#### Consistency Model

- **Eventual Consistency**:
  - Applied for non-critical updates (social signals, market trends)
  - Conflict resolution strategies using vector clocks
  - Background reconciliation for divergent states

- **Strong Consistency**:
  - Used for financial transactions and ownership changes
  - Two-phase commit for critical state transitions
  - Optimistic concurrency control for high-contention resources

#### Partition Tolerance

- **Sharding Strategy**:
  - Entity-based partitioning (NFTs, collections, creators)
  - Consistent hashing for load distribution
  - Partition rebalancing without downtime

- **Failure Handling**:
  - Partition isolation to contain failures
  - Read-only mode for partially available services
  - Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures

#### Scalability Architecture

- **Horizontal Scaling**:
  - Stateless services with auto-scaling capabilities
  - Resource-based scaling triggers (CPU, memory, queue depth)
  - Workload-aware scaling policies

- **Distributed Tracing**:
  - OpenTelemetry integration for request tracing
  - Correlation IDs across service boundaries
  - Latency profiling and bottleneck identification

### 3. Real-time Processing Optimization

#### Data Structures

- **Memory-Efficient Representations**:
  - Bloom filters for rapid membership testing
  - Sparse matrices for relationship graphs
  - Compressed bitsets for feature flags
  - LFU/LRU caches with size constraints

#### Algorithm Optimization

- **Incremental Computation**:
  - Delta-based updates for score components
  - Materialized views for frequent query patterns
  - Approximate algorithms for non-critical metrics

- **Data Locality**:
  - Co-located processing for related entities
  - Cache warming for predictable access patterns
  - Data prefetching based on dependency graphs

#### I/O Optimization

- **Batching Strategies**:
  - Time-based batching for low-latency requirements
  - Size-based batching for throughput optimization
  - Priority-based batching for mixed workloads

- **Adaptive Processing**:
  - Backpressure mechanisms for traffic spikes
  - Dynamic thread pool sizing
  - Resource-aware task scheduling

### 4. Operational Considerations

  - Application metrics (throughput, latency, error rates)
  - Business metrics (update volumes, notification relevance)

#### Configuration Management

- **Centralized Configuration**:

  - Feature flags for gradual rollout
  - Dynamic configuration updates without restart
  - Audit trail for configuration changes

#### Disaster Recovery

- **Backup Strategy**:
  - Regular state snapshots
  - Transaction log backups
